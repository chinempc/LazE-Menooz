# LazE Menyooz the University Dining Dish Tracker

Welcome to LazE Menyooz the University Dining Dish Tracker! This project began as a personal quest to satisfy my craving for Barbecue Beef Briskets at the UMES. What started as a simple tool to track my favorite dish has now evolved into a comprehensive app for all students to stay updated on their preferred dining hall offerings

### Current Schools we support are 
* University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES)
* Towson University (Coming Soon...)
* Bowie State University (Coming Soon...)
